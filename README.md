- LED Dot Matrix -> is a display technology that uses a grid of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged in rows and columns to create images, text, or animations. Each individual LED acts as a pixel, and by turning specific LEDs on or off, or by adjusting their brightness, the matrix can display various patterns or information.
